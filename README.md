## Introducing the Colo Fun Framework

The Colo Fun framework is an AI agent-driven game framework built upon the [G.A.M.E. framework](https://github.com/game-by-virtuals) from the [Virtual Protocol](https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol). G.A.M.E. is a modular agentic framework that enables agents to autonomously plan actions and make decisions based on the information provided.

By leveraging the strengths of the G.A.M.E. framework, the Colo Fun framework offers an efficient and flexible development environment, assisting developers in creating complex applications with ease.
